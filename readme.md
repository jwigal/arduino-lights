Arduino Christmas Tree Lights
=============================

A couple of light patterns that we came up with...

* *Traditional:* multi-colored lights that fade every 15 seconds or so
* *Pop-Fade:* green light set that turns a few lights a random color every few seconds
* *Rainbow-Lights:* show the full 255 color spectrum from top to bottom
